    "**Idea** Investigate how country data related to a country's general well-being is predictive of the success of related small wiki language projects. There are certain measures of social and financial prosperity that alledgedly predict the well-being and quality of life in a country. <br>\n",

    "**Why are you planning to do this analysis?** In my DRG this quarter, I am working with a PhD student who is investigating disinformation on small language editions of Wikipedia (also called projects sometimes). In larger language editions of Wikipedia, like the English edition, content moderation and verification is pretty well managed, but smaller wikis are more vulnerable to disinformation and related issues. One such issue is called project capture, where a small group of ideologues or extremists takes control of an entire wikipedia edition and spins the articles to support their world views. One of the most notorious and extreme instances of project capture occurred on Croatian Wikipedia (see more: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost/2021-06-27/Disinformation_report). So far in our research in the DRG, we've seem that some small wikipedias seem to be more vulnerable to disinformation and capture, while others are much more functional. I am interested in seeing how sociopolitical factors in the countries where these languages are spoken compare, to see if it might be predictive of the project's vulnerability to disinformation. <br>\n",

    "**Why is it potentially interesting and useful, from a scientific, practical, and/or human-centered perspective?** Wikipedia is one of the most important and most used sources of information on the internet. Most google knowledge panels (the small panel of information that pops up when you google something that you can read without clinking any links) are sourced from Wikipedia. Combatting misinformation and disinformation on Wikipedia is essential to combatting mis- and disinformation overall. <br>\n",
