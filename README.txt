This repository contains work for two different projects. Files/notebooks starting with "wiki" are part of my original project idea, and files/notebooks starting with "ukraine" are part of my new project idea.

Short summary of wiki project idea: Investigate how country data related to a country's general well-being is predictive of the success of related small wiki language projects. There are certain measures of social and financial prosperity that alledgedly predict the well-being and quality of life in a country.

Short summary of Ukraine project idea: Investigate how the Russian government uses disinformation in the Russia-Ukraine war/conflict and the events leading up to it.
